<p class="shead">Hera</p>
<p>Greek origin.  Goddess of Marriage and Childbirth.  Daughter of Rhea and Cronus (Cronos), sister and wife of Zeus, and mother of Ares, Hebe, Hephaestus, and Eileithyia.  She was swallowed by Cronus when born, like her siblings Poseidon, Hades, Demeter, and Hestia; they were all rescued when Zeus made Cronus vomit them up, and she eventually married him.  Zeus and Heraâ€™s stories are rarely examples of domestic bliss; most of the mythology that Hera is represented in shows her spiteful side as she is often portrayed attacking the many mistresses of her husband, and their demi-god children, such as Heracles (Hercules).  Her symbols include the peacock, and she is often shown wearing a crown or a wedding veil while carrying a scepter.</p>

<p class="shead">Poseidon</p>
<p>Greek origin.  God of the Sea and Earthquakes.  Son of Rhea and Cronus (Cronos), brother of Zeus, Hera, Hades, Hestia, and Demeter.  Husband of Amphitrite, a sea nymph.  Poseidon was given the sea to rule after entering a game of straws with Zeus and Hades: whoever pulled the longest got control of the sky, the middle control of the sea, and the shortest control over the Underworld.  Zeus won first, Poseidon second, and Hades third, hence their respective placements.  Poseidon is often portrayed as very similar to Zeus, both in recklessness and masculinity; he had his fair share of demi-god children, and was an unruly god who was as tempestuous as his domain.  Just because he was powerful didnâ€™t mean he always won his battles: Athens was won by Athena during their contest to see who could create the best gift for the city, where his salt-water stream was outdone by her olive tree.  His symbols include the trident, a three-pronged spear.</p>

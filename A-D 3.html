<p class="shead">Athena</p>
<p>Greek origin.  Goddess of War and Strategy, Craft, and Wisdom.  Daughter of Zeus and Metis: Zeus swallowed Metis while pregnant, and Athena erupted from his head in her battle armor once fully grown, with help from Hephaestus, who cracked open Zeus’s skull to let her out.  Other common myths include the rivalry between Athena and Ariadne, who she turned into a spider, and the beginnings of Medusa, who she turned into a gorgon and who was eventually killed by Perseus.  Athens became her city when Athena and Poseidon fought about who would rule over it; Athena won by creating an olive tree.  She is usually presented as a guide or a moral figure to seek support and knowledge from, and aided many heroes including Heracles (Hercules), Perseus, and Jason.  Among her symbols are the owl and the aegis (her breastplate with Medusa’s head imprinted on the metal).</p>

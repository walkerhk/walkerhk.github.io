<p class="shead">Vulcan</p>
<p>Roman origin.  God of the Smithy and Metalworks, based off the Greek Hephaestus.  Son of Juno, who bore him alone without a male partner; mythology says she either found him too ugly or disliked the fact he was disabled (he is depicted as a cripple), and she threw him out the window into the ocean, where he was rescued by Thetis.  Husband to Venus, the goddess of Love and Beauty, a marriage that is presented roughly with neither particularly happy about the arrangement.  When Minerva (Greek Athena) was born, Vulcan was the one who split Jupiterâ€™s skull to allow the goddess to emerge.  Common symbols for him include fire and blacksmith tools.</p>

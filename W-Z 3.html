<p class="shead">Zeus</p>
<p>Greek origin.  God of the Sky, ruler of the other gods and goddesses.  Son of Rhea and Cronus (Cronos), brother and husband of Hera, and father of Athena, Ares, Apollo, Artemis, Dionysus, Hermes, and many others both gods, goddesses, and demi-gods.  The origin myth for Zeus includes his being hidden away by his mother until he was old enough to rival his father; Zeus returned and defeated Cronos, making him vomit up all of his siblings, and afterwards cut up the titan into pieces which were tossed into the Underworld.  He later married Hera, but their marriage had many difficulties, mostly because Zeus often had an interest in mortals that resulted in children (such as the hero Heracles, also called Hercules).  Treated as the most powerful god, his symbols include the lightning bolt and eagle.</p>
